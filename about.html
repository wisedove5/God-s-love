  God's Love</h1></pre>

   From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible speaks of God’s love for us. The book of Psalms alone
   has many verses describing God’s love for us. David described God’s love with these words, 
   “Your love, LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies” (Psalm 36:4). He
   goes on to write, “How priceless is your unfailing love, O God” (Psalm 36:7).In another Psalm,
   David wrote, You, LORD, are forgiving and good abounding in love to all who call to you” 
   (Psalm 86:15).
   
   
   The verses in Psalms shows what love is ,God's love is greater. Even if we do bad things 
   God's love will never fade away. His love is much stronger than ours. We should understand 
   his love and be his children. Even words could not explain his love. We should not disobey
   God we should love him and obey him. God showed his undying love by sending his son to die 
   for us in the cross to forgive us from our sins. We should show our love by obeying God and
   we should not sin.Satan is tempting us to disobey God. We can show love by doing the things
   God wants us to do like praying at least 3 times a day or listening to your parents these 
   small  things can make a big difference. We should understand his love. God is our saviour,
   our father and we should always love our God , Jesus.</pre></b></h3>
